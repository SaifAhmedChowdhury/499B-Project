In Bangladesh industry hazard and worker safety has increasingly become a paramount issue. The recent debacle of Tazreen Garments, other various industrial accidents have resulted in loss of lives, livelihood of families but also created an image crisis in the wider global world. 

This was the impetus for us to delve into the problem to tackle from its root and technology has armed us to do so. The objective was to develop a cost effective comprehensive monitoring system that not only detects various hazards such as fire, smoke but also monitor the heat stress of the worker. The conceptual idea was to design a framework that would able to address as much of these issues as possible within the boundaries of physical and technical possibilities.

In our endeavor to look into the solutions we have also delved on the health aspect as well. From field monitoring conducted by a team from BUET, it was observed that production spaces in Readymade Garments (RMG) were adversely impacted by excessively hot indoor environments, and yet thousands of workers toiling away their days doing production work-in these spaces. Such excessive indoor temperatures, much higher than the workerâ€™s normal body temperature, have an adverse impact on physiological conditions potentially leading health risks. 

This has been an often-overlooked issue and often leads to unreported productivity loss in form of sick leave and other latent health effects. So, using extrapolated WGBT modeling we were able to device a monitoring system that would be able to report worker discomfort and also automatically regulate the indoor temperature by adjusting ventilation setting.
